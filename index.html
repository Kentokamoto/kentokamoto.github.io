      Hello ðŸ‘‹! My name is Kento Okamoto. I write code. Sometimes the computer
      does what I want it to do; sometimes, it doesn't. Most of my focus is on
      the backend in languages like C++ and Python.
    </p>
    <p class="text-l py-2">
      I've worked for companies like

        >Arista Networks</a
      >
      where I've helped with the bring up process of the Arista EOS on the 720XP
      series campus PoE ethernet switches, and
      <a class="text-nord10 dark:text-nord7" href="https://lithic.com/"
        >Lithic</a
