      Hello ðŸ‘‹! I'm Kento. I write code. Sometimes the computer does what I want
      it to do; most of the time, it doesn't. Currently based in Seattle
      Washington but have also lived in the Bay Area and Denver area.

      I've worked for companies like

      where I've helped with the bring up process of the Arista EOS on the 720XP
      series campus PoE ethernet switches, and
      <a class="text-nord10 dark:text-nord7" href="https://lithic.com/"

    Most of my focus is on the backend in languages like Python and C++ but I'm
    currently exploring other areas like fullstack web development and new
    programming languages on the side. Some of my current interests on the side
    include:
