I imagine everyone goes through a phase where they want to start a blog about something. This is another one of those blogs.

So, hello!, I am a software developer with most of my experience being in backend systems ranging from hardware/software \
integration and to developing microservices for an end product. I'm currently spending my free time exploring other areas outside\
of backend software such as basic web development (hence why this page is currently being worked on) and exploring open source\
projects I could contribute to while I am looking for my next opportunity. My GitHub page in its current state is very basic but\
I promise I'll improve the aesthetics of it over time.

My intention with these posts is to write a little snippet about what's going on in my life from time to time whether it be about\
things I'm learning right now or just random things that I do outside of coding on a daily basis. We'll see where this goes.
